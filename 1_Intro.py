# why Python, inventor of it ?
# what is REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) and REPLIT?

# what is module (called using import numpy) ?
# diff between external and built in modules
# built in modules like hashlib, __main__
# what is pip? (package installer for python)

# installing external modules (using terminal)
# pip install pandas
# pip install numpy
# pip install scikit-learn


# Python → Simple, powerful language by Guido van Rossum (1991)
# REPL → Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop execution model built for Python
# REPLIT → Online Python IDE that supports REPL internally
# Module → Reusable code file
# Built-in module → Comes with Python
# External module → Installed using pip
# pip → Package Installer for Python
